Revision history for Perl extension ExtUtils::ModuleMaker.

0.32_07 January 3 2005
	- Correction of documentation error:  ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::new() now takes a hash reference rather than a list.

0.32_06 December 18 2004
	- Further cleanup by James E Keenan:
	    - Eliminate causes of warnings while using 'modulemaker' utility
	    - Change to ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::new():  Instead of
	      passing a hash-like list, pass a reference to an anonymous
hash, i.e., enclose list of arguments inside {} (CANCELLED in 0.33)

0.32_05 December 1 2004
	- Further cleanup by James E Keenan:
	    - Deletion of superseded/deprecated subroutines and
              corresponding POD

0.32_03 November 13 2004
	- James E Keenan's patches:
        - ModuleMaker.pm:
            - Corrected typing errors in several places
            - Modified ORGANIZATION in POD to parallel wording of CPANID
            - Changed $defaults{ABSTRACT} to 'Module abstract 
              (<= 44 characters) goes here'
            - Allowed for ORGANIZATION, where defined, to be included in 
              AUTHOR COMPOSITE and thereby included in Author section of POD
	    - Fixed Block_Begin() and Block_Begin_BareBones() to eliminate 
              blank first line in .pm files
        - t/*.t
	    - Corrected names of test files on first lines of each of 
              02_simple.t, 03_quick.t and 04_compact.t
            - Created 05_abstract. to test current and new features:
              -- correct Author and Email in Makefile.PL
              -- placement of Abstract in POD
              -- placement of Author info in POD
              -- placement of History info in POD rather than in Changes
        - scripts/modulemaker
            - Included ABSTRACT	in Main Menu and created prompt for
              new abstract
            - Allowed for additional command-line options for specification 
              of abstract and author info
            - Modified Usage message to reflect additional command-line 
              options; placed options in alphabetical order


0.32 June 16 2003 (YAPC::Boca_Raton)
	- Removed Fakefile.PL that was for testing but only caused
	  problems.  The content has been held over after __END__
	  in Makefile.PL
	- Added missing fullname for libpng license which was causing
	  an odd number of parts in a hash
	- Added support for Module::Build (patch from Dave Rolsky)
	- Fixed misplaced backslash when generating the new method
	- Generated Makefile.PL now has a prerequisite of Test::Simple

	- New interactive script 'modulemaker'
	- Removed old scripts 'newmodule' and 'eumm'
	- Old functions are deprecated, but still here for now
