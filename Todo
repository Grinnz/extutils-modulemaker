Verify these two:

documentation:  Author info.  If I don't want Company / Website info, then I shouldn't get the dummy copy.

When you ask for sub new to be inserted, it fails to not-insert Exporter info.

Long-range plan:
1.  Upload as v0.33 what I sent to Avery as v0.32_07.
2.  Then, try to upgrade the test coverage -- in effect, "phalanx" it,
particularly the modulemaker utility.
3.  Finally, add features suggested by other modules (e.g.,
Module::Starter) which have themselves been influenced by EU::MM.

-----
Short-range plan:

* Test death_message().

* Refactor BEGIN blocks in lib/ExtUtils/Modulemaker/Licenses/*.pm.

* Analyze whether SecondStyle.pm is still needed.  Geoff used it to
* demonstrate subclassability -- but my version is now pure-OO and I
* don't want internals subclassed.

* For backward compatibility, replace use warnings with 'local $^W = 1;'.  Also
* eliminate lexically scoped filehandles $fh. (I didn't actually have
* any, but t/03..04 had a filehandle FILE which I lexically scoped:
* 'local *FH;')  DONE
