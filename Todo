1.  Testing of modulemaker interactive mode.  I wasn't able to apply
Expect::Simple successfully to this task.  It wasn't capturing the text
printed to STDOUT at program launch, nor was it capturing the final text so
printed.  And it gave different results with new invocations of a given test
file.  So, other than my own idiosyncratic testing, the interactive mode is
untested.

2.  Still trying to resolve moderate problems with modulemaker utility.  If in
command-line mode you try to specify an empty string as the argument to -p
(CPANID), -o (ORGANIZATION) or -w (WEBSITE) (and perhaps others not yet
discovered), those values do *not* appear on the interactive mode's AUTHOR
menu.  Instead, you get the default values -- either
ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::Defaults or ExtUtils::ModuleMaker::Personal Defaults,
if the latter is installed.  OTOH, if you store a personal defaults file with
an empty string as the value for, say, ORGANIZATION, your lib/*.pm file will
be created correctly (with no extra linespace for the missing attribute).
Furthermore, if on the command-line you specify an empty string for any of
those three attributes and you suppress interactive mode with -I option, the
lib/*.pm file will use the default value, which is not what you wanted.
